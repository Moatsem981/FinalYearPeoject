3,Paneer,"['2 quarts whole milk', 'Juice of 2 lemons', '½ teaspoon kosher salt']","In a medium saucepan, heat the milk to 195°F over medium heat. Using a wooden spoon, stir frequently during the heating process to prevent the milk from scalding. Be sure to scrape the bottom of the pan when you stir because this is where the milk is most prone to sticking. The milk will become foamy and bubbles will form on its surface once it reaches the desired temperature.
Remove from the heat and stir in the lemon juice until evenly distributed, which will cause the separation of curds from the whey. The process should begin right away, but don’t fret if it takes a minute or two. Cover the pan and set aside at room temperature for 10 minutes to let the acid work its magic. Check the mixture at this point: It should be slightly yellow and the curds should have completely separated from the whey. Don’t panic if this hasn’t happened completely yet. Simply add another teaspoon of acid and set aside for a few minutes more. This should do the trick.
Line a fine-mesh sieve with cheesecloth and set the sieve over a bowl. Ladle the curds and whey into the sieve. Reserve the whey for another use. Season the curds (still in the sieve) with salt, stirring it in using a wooden spoon, then gather up the edges of the cheesecloth into a tight bundle and squeeze the excess whey from the curds. Place the cheesecloth and curds on a large plate and shape them into a square. Wrap the cheesecloth edges around the paneer and place a second plate on top of it to compress it. Set aside at room temperature for 30 minutes. At this point the paneer is ready to use or it can be refrigerated in a covered container for up to 3 days.",homemade-paneer-recipe,"['2 quarts whole milk', 'Juice of 2 lemons', '½ teaspoon kosher salt']",lemon
4,R-Rated Onions,"['4–5 large or 6–8 medium yellow or white onions', '1 Tbsp olive or vegetable oil', '1 tsp kosher salt']","Peel your onions and cut them in half through their stem ends—longways, if you will. Slice them thinly with the grain, following the line from root to stem rather than cutting the onion across its belly. This is actually important because slicing it the other way makes the path to silky onions a longer one.
Once your onions are sliced, heat your skillet over medium-high heat and add the oil, then the onions and the salt. Let the onions sizzle for a couple minutes. Stir with a wooden spoon or a heatproof spatula and watch as they wilt for about 3 more minutes. At this point, reduce the heat to medium low. Put a lid on and step away for a few minutes. Give the onions a stir every now and then. You don’t have to stand over it like risotto, but don’t go for a walk around the block either. Caramelized bits will accumulate at the bottom and sides of the pan, and that’s good. Just scrape them up and stir them in. A little color building as you go is okay, but don’t rush to brown them. The point is to cook the onions gently, coaxing them through stages of raw, wilted, sweaty, soft, light brown, and finally deeply caramelized
About 45 minutes in, remove the lid for the last time. They should be a light caramel color. Now, with the lid off, you will need to watch more closely and stir more frequently. At some point you may find that despite your best efforts some of the caramelized bits, verging on burnt, cling to the pan and threaten over all onion ruin. Do not fret! Just add a ½ cup or so of water and use its energy to help scrape up the stubborn but tasty film. Let the water cook out of course. When you’re smiling over a soft, creamy, fragrant pile of mahogany onions, you’re done.

Place cauliflower, cut side down, on grate over hottest part of grill and grill, undisturbed, until char marks form, about 3 minutes (you can carefully lift to check, but try not to move too much). Turn over onto other cut side and grill, undisturbed, until grill marks form, about 3 minutes. Turn onto uneven floret side and slide over to cooler part of grill or reduce heat to low and cover with lid. Grill until tender (if a bamboo skewer easily slides through the thickest part, it’s done), 10–15 minutes. (And if you don’t have a grill, you can do this in a grill pan over high. Once pan is very hot, add cauliflower, reduce heat to medium-high, and cook both cut sides as above. When you turn cauliflower over onto uneven floret side, reduce heat to low and cover pan with foil to finish cooking.)

Line a plate with paper towels. Heat 2 Tbsp of oil in a large sauté pan over medium-high heat.

You’re looking for uniform blistering, but you don’t want them to become too soggy in the process, especially if you intend to stuff them, since they need to hold their shape. The process will probably take 10 to 15 minutes. Once they are well blistered and before the flesh is completely charred through in any spots, place the peppers in a plastic container with a tight-fitting lid or in a bowl that you can cover with a plate (not a towel or anything porous) and set aside to “sweat” for about 10 minutes, or until they are cool enough to handle.
Remove the charred skin from the whole chiles. Once you have removed and discarded the skin and seeds, cut them into rajas, or strips, about the width of fettuccine.
In a small saucepan, cover the potatoes with 2 inches / 5cm water and add the salt. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then decrease to low and simmer for about 5 minutes. Remove one of the potatoes and taste it. The piece should be soft but not falling apart, still holding its cube shape. Cubed like this, they will cook quite quickly, so be attentive. Once they have the right texture, drain the potatoes and set aside in a medium bowl with a lid or cover the pan with a plate to keep them warm.
Using the same comal or skillet in which you toasted your chiles, heat the oil over medium-high heat until it’s hot but not smoking. Add the onion and sauté until it’s translucent but not browned.
In a saucepan, combine the potatoes, chiles, onion, and crema or crème fraîche. Bring to a boil, then turn off the heat and let it sit for 5 to 10 minutes. As the mixture cools, the starches will absorb some of the melted cream and help it firm up. Taste and add more salt if needed. Serve as you wish!

Combine the cheese, oregano, and garlic in a small bowl. Divide the mixture between the steaks and spread it out almost to the edges. Roll the steaks up so that the grain of the meat runs the length of the roll, so you’ll be slicing them across the grain. Tie the steaks closed with the twine every 2 inches or so.

Put the stuffed steaks on the grill directly over the fire. Close the lid and cook, turning the rolls every 2 to 3 minutes for even browning, until 5 to 10°F shy of the desired doneness; start checking them with an instant-read thermometer after 10 minutes. Depending on the thickness of the rolls, they should take 15 to 20 minutes total for medium-rare.
Transfer to a cutting board and let rest 5 to 10 minutes, checking the internal temperature. (Or nick with a small knife and peek inside.) Cut the rolls into 1-inch slices, transfer them spiral side up to a platter, pour over any accumulated juices, and serve.

Turn the dough out onto the counter. Working quickly and using an offset spatula, spread it into a very thin (1/8-inch-thick) rectangular sheet roughly 24x20 inches. Use a paring knife to trim the rectangle to an 18-inch square. (Discard the trimmings or snack on them.) Then cut that square into four precise 9-inch squares. The dough cools and sets quickly so you will be able to peel each of the four squares off the counter easily as you need them.
Preheat the oven to 375°F. Grease a 9-inch square baking dish with cooking spray.

Microwave each bowl separately, stirring occasionally, until the candy is smooth, about 1 minute. Using a small, clean craft brush or your fingertip, paint spots in the 3 different colors of melted candy in an even layer (not too thin) over the top side of each leaf. While the candy is still wet, swirl the colors slightly to blend. Place the leaf on one of the cookie sheets, coated side up. Repeat with the remaining leaves. If the candy becomes too thick, reheat in the microwave for several seconds, stirring frequently. Place the cookie sheets in the refrigerator until the candy is set, about 5 minutes.
Carefully peel the leaves from the hardened candy. They come off surprisingly easily. Use a toothpick or clean tweezers to remove any small pieces of leaf that may remain. (The leaves and other candy pieces can be made up to 5 days in advance, covered, and kept in a cool dry place.)

342,Josh Ozersky's Favorite Burger,"['5 slices American deli-style cheese, halved, room temperature', '10 white, unseeded, soft white super market dinner rolls, split in half horizontally', '1 pound (455 g) fresh ground chuck, 80/20 or 70/30 meat-to-fat ratio (Josh prefers 70/30)', '1 large yellow onion (you can use a red onion if you like)', 'Kosher salt to taste', 'Oil, for cooking', 'Condiments of your choice']","Arrange the individual cheese slices and open the buns on a platter or cutting board near your cooking surface. Once the burgers start to cook, you will need them quickly. Divide the meat into 10 even portions. Roll each one into a meatball about the size of a ping-pong ball.
Dice the onion medium-fine and place in a small bowl. Add warm salted water just to cover and set beside the stove. Heat a skillet over high heat until very hot. If you have an infrared thermometer, the skillet should register at least 500°F (250°C). Or test by brushing on a bit of oil. When the skillet starts to smoke, it is ready.
While the skillet is heating, working one at a time, flatten a meatball slightly and sprinkle it liberally on both sides with kosher salt. Salt drives much of this recipe. Brush oil onto the skillet and place the flattened ball on it. Just after it hits the pan, flip it over and using a solid, reinforced metal spatula, press hard to flatten it. You want it really thin. Do this just once, while the meat is still cold.
After the burger has sizzled for about 30 to 40 seconds, top with about a tablespoon (15 g) of the watery onions. This will produce a good amount of onion fumes. That’s okay. Spread the water and onions as evenly as you can and press them gently into the meat; don’t squish down hard.
Wait another 30 seconds and taking great care to lift the meat from the pan with its crust intact, flip it over. Immediately put a slice of cheese on the meat and a bottom bun on top of the cheese. Wait another 10 to 15 seconds and remove onto a top bun. Invert onto serving platter and repeat to make 10 sliders.

The amount of salt you use should come to about 1.5–2.5%, but no more than 3%, of the cabbage weight.
In a large bowl, mix and massage the salt through the cabbage thoroughly, making sure to distribute the salt evenly.
Let it sit to sweat a bit—maybe 10 minutes. This is simply to make the next step easier. This is a good time to get your vessel cleaned and to rest up for the next stage.
With your pounder, pound quite energetically for about 5–10 minutes, until the cabbage is dripping with its own salty water when you pick up a handful. This part is important as you need this liquid—it’s your brine.
You can also use the dough hook of a stand mixer to do the pounding part, which can speed things up somewhat. Don’t let it run for too long though, only a few minutes. Using a mixer is easy and great for people who are doing this a lot and in large batches, but it takes quite a bit of the emotional release and fun out of it.
Next, mix in the caraway seeds (if using).
Put the mixture into the jar, packing it down tightly as you go using the pounder. Push down well, particularly at the end to coax out any more brine. You need the brine to cover the cabbage.
Don’t pack the cabbage all the way to the top; leave some headroom at the top of the jar to allow for a bit of growth and movement and, of course, the weight. You don’t want the liquid touching the top of the lid, as it will end up spewing out of your air-lock or up out of your lid.
Cover with a cabbage leaf (the follower), the weight and then your chosen lid or system.
Depending on your ferment, you can start trying it as soon as you’d like, but the less you fiddle with it in the first 2 weeks, the better. It is ready when you think it is delicious. With the right system and temperature, you can leave it to ferment for months before refrigeration.
If you used a crock, you’ll need to decant the kraut to smaller jars before you refrigerate, unless you have a walk-in cool room, or large cellar. (Lucky you.)

Put the pancetta and a small glug of olive oil in a skillet or Dutch oven that’s large enough to hold all the pasta. Cook until the pancetta is lightly browned but still slightly chewy, 9 to 12 minutes (or less if you’re using thinly sliced pancetta). Season the pancetta very generously with pepper. Take the skillet off the heat, but don’t drain anything—you’ll use that fat!
When the water is at a boil, add the pasta and cook according to the package directions until almost al dente. When the pasta is almost ready, add the shelled peas to the pasta pot.
Put the skillet back over medium heat and reheat the pancetta gently.
With a ladle or a measuring cup, scoop out about 1 cup of the pasta cooking water. Drain the pasta and peas. Whisk a couple of tablespoons of the pasta water into the fat and pancetta in the skillet, to make the bacon fat lighter and creamier by emulsifying it with the water. Pull the pan off the heat.
Whisk some of that warm fat into the beaten egg to temper it (meaning to gently warm up the egg so that it doesn’t scramble when you add it to the hot skillet), then whisk the egg into the skillet.
Dump the pasta, peas, scallions, and pea tendrils (if using) into the skillet. Add both the cheeses and toss everything quickly and thoroughly to blend. Add a few more small splashes of the pasta water and keep tossing until the noodles are cloaked in a creamy sauce. Taste and adjust the seasoning with more salt or black pepper as needed.

Squeamish about raw egg yolks and anchovies? Sorry. Yolks are what give richness to the emulsion, while anchovies provide a briny blast (and that whole umami thing). Here's our go-to recipe: Chop together 6 anchovy fillets packed in oil, 1 small garlic clove, and a pinch of kosher salt.

Use whole leaves from 3 romaine hearts to feed 6 people. They provide the ideal mix of crispness, surface area, and structure.
Caesars crowned with a mound of grated Parmesan may look impressive, but all that clumpy cheese mutes the dressing. Instead, use a vegetable peeler to thinly shave a modest amount on top for little salty bursts.

398,"""Cold-Fry"" Frites","['2 pounds (1 kg/about 4 large) russet potatoes', '2 1/2 quarts (2.5 l) vegetable oil, such as sunflower oil, at room temperature', 'Fine sea salt', 'A French-fry cutter (optional); 2 thick, clean kitchen towels; a 4- to 9-quart (4 to 9 l) heavy-duty saucepan or cast-iron pot; a kitchen timer; a wire skimmer or slotted metal spoon; 2 trays lined with paper towels; a warmed platter.']","Rinse the potatoes, peel them, rinse again, and cut lengthwise into 3/8-inch (10 mm) fries. (Precision is not essential here: I love the tiny, crunchy, almost-burned bits that emerge from the fryer.)
Soak the potatoes in a bowl of cold water for about 5 minutes, changing the water when it becomes cloudy (at least twice), until the water remains clear. (Soaking releases the starch in potatoes, making them less rigid and less likely to stick together while cooking.)
Drain the potatoes and wrap them in the kitchen towels to dry. (Removing the excess liquid will speed up the cooking time and reduce the likelihood of the potatoes splattering once the oil is hot.)
Transfer the potatoes to the saucepan and set it over the stove. Pour the oil over the potatoes. Do not cover the pot. Set the heat to high, stirring the potatoes gently with a metal spoon to distribute and prevent sticking. (A metal spoon lets you feel if any potato bits are stuck to the bottom of the pan and scrape them up.)
The oil should move from a peppy simmer to a boil in about 9 minutes. When the oil starts to boil, set a timer for 17 minutes. Stir the potatoes very gently every 3 to 4 minutes to prevent sticking and ensure even cooking. Don’t worry about overboiling—the oil should boil rapidly and evenly with no need to adjust the heat throughout the entire process.
When the timer rings, the potatoes should have begun to take on color, turning from white to slightly golden, but will still have about 4 minutes remaining until they are fully cooked. For these last few minutes, watch them closely, stirring gently. When the fries are a deep golden brown, taste one to make sure they are truly crisp and firm on the outside with a creamy interior. They should not be the least bit soggy, so resist the urge to remove them from the oil too soon. When you are happy with the consistency, carefully transfer the rest of the fries with the wire skimmer or slotted spoon to the paper-towel-lined trays to drain. Season with salt and serve immediately on the warmed platter.
Use firm, fresh potatoes. Rinse and soak them well to rid them of starch. The less starch in the potatoes, the crispier the fries will be.
To keep the oil well contained in the pot, make sure there is at least 2 inches (5 cm) of room from the top of the oil to the rim of the pot.
We have made these fries in varied quantities with proportionate quantities of oil and pot size: 1 pound (500 g) potatoes/1 1/2 quarts (1.5 l) oil/4-quart (4 l) pot 2 pounds (1 kg) potatoes/2 1/2 quarts (2.5 l) oil/5- to 7-quart (5 to 7 l) pot 3 pounds (1.5 kg) potatoes/3 quarts (3 l) oil/7-quart (7 l) pot 4 pounds (2 kg) potatoes/4 quarts (4 l) oil/8- to 9-quart (8 to 9 l) pot
Do not use an aluminum pot; it will not hold the heat in the same manner as a heavy cast-iron or stainless steel pot, and the results may not be satisfactory.
After frying, let the oil cool and strain it through cheesecloth into the original containers. Store in the refrigerator and reuse up to five times. Mark the bottles as to number of uses and sniff the oil before reusing; if there is any scent of rancidity, toss. Each time the oil is reused, add about 1 cup (250 ml) fresh, new oil to the mix.",cold-fry-frites,"['2 pounds (1 kg/about 4 large) russet potatoes', '2 1/2 quarts (2.5 l) vegetable oil, such as sunflower oil, at room temperature', 'Fine sea salt', 'A French-fry cutter (optional); 2 thick', 'clean kitchen towels; a 4- to 9-quart (4 to 9 l) heavy-duty saucepan or cast-iron pot; a kitchen timer; a wire skimmer or slotted metal spoon; 2 trays lined with paper towels; a warmed platter.']",potato

Turn the fish over and repeat with the remaining 1/4 teaspoon of turmeric. Set the salmon aside as you prepare the spice paste.
Combine the vinegar, chiles, salt, and nutmeg in a small bowl to make a slurry. Set the slurry aside.
Fill up a medium-size bowl with cold water. Take a leaf of kale, cut along both sides of the tough rib, and discard it. Slice the leaf in half lengthwise. Repeat with the remaining leaves. Stack the leaf halves, about 6 at a time, one on top of the other, and roll them into a tight log. Thinly slice the log crosswise; you will end up with long, slender shreds. When cutting the kale, you can’t help notice how strong smelling and grassy it is (no wonder I love the smell of fresh-mowed grass in the summer). Dunk the shreds into the bowl of water to rinse off any grit, then scoop the shreds out and drain them in a colander. Repeat once or twice if the kale does not appear clean.
Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Once the oil appears to shimmer, add the turmeric-smeared fillet to the skillet. The instant sizzle and sear will turn the salmon light brown on the underside, about 2 minutes. Turn it over and repeat with the second side, about 2 minutes. Transfer the fish to a plate. Add the garlic to the skillet and stir-fry it until light brown and aromatic, about 1 minute.
Pour the vinegar-based spice slurry into the skillet and stir to mix with the garlic. Simmer, uncovered, stirring occasionally, about 2 minutes. The pungency will slap you in the face (in a good way—I promise) and the liquid will release all the browned bits of fish from the bottom of the skillet into the thin sauce.
Add the kale shreds and stir to coat them evenly with the liquid. Pour 1/2 cup of water into the skillet and stir. Lower the heat to medium, cover the skillet, and stew the kale, stirring occasionally, until the shreds are tender when tested (and tasted, I hope), 5 to 8 minutes.
Stir the coconut milk into the kale. Let the milk come to a boil uncovered. Add the seared salmon to the liquid, basting it to make sure it continues to poach. Cook, uncovered, scooping up the sauce and basting the fish occasionally, until it barely starts to flake, 3 to 5 minutes.
Transfer the fish to a serving plate. Let the sauce boil, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until it thickens, 3 to 4 minutes. Pour the sauce over the salmon and serve.
A stout bunch, dark green and spritely, Tuscan kale stands for the epitome of winter bravado. Even though it grows all through the year, we often associate kale with cold weather, that brightness among a sea of white, very much like the evergreen Christmas tree. Curly, ornamental (those tight bases of light purple leaves with a frizzy head of green), or Russian kale—all varieties work well for this recipe. Bursting with antioxidants, vitamins A and C, and iron, kale is a nutritional powerhouse among a sea of greens. Its tough leaves make it harder to cook than some greens, but with the right amount of moisture, it turns tender within about 5 minutes.
To grind the chiles de árbol, pulverize them in a spice grinder (like a coffee grinder) until they are the texture of finely ground black pepper. The heat from freshly ground dried chiles is much more intense than preground cayenne.
Before opening a can of coconut milk, shake it well to make sure the thick milk gets dispersed evenly. If the can sits around unopened, the thicker part usually floats to the top and congeals into a creamy mass. If shaking does nothing (usually if the can has been sitting in a cool spot, this will happen), then once you open the can, scrape the contents into a small bowl, and whisk the thicker milk with the wheylike separated liquid to create an evenly thick milk.",creamy-wild-salmon-with-kale,"['1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric', '1 1/2 pounds skinless, boneless wild salmon fillet in a single piece (such as Alaskan or Copper River)', '1/4 cup cider vinegar', '4 dried red cayenne chiles (like chile de árbol), stems discarded, ground (do not remove the seeds; see Extra Credit below) or 1 teaspoon ground red pepper (cayenne)', '1 teaspoon coarse kosher or sea salt', '1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg', '1 medium-size bunch fresh kale (about 8 ounces)', '2 tablespoons canola oil', '6 large cloves garlic, either thinly sliced or finely chopped', '1 can (13.5 to 15 ounces) unsweetened coconut milk (see Extra Credit below)']",garlic

To make the spicy tomato sauce, in a large saucepan over low heat, combine the olive oil, garlic, tomatoes, Maras pepper, and hawayej. Simmer until the tomatoes are soft and melted, about 15 minutes. It is important to cook the sauce slowly so the tomatoes are soft enough to puree but don’t reduce too much. Set the sauce aside to cool slightly.
Using an immersion blender and starting at low speed, puree the sauce, gradually increasing the speed as the mixture becomes smoother and resembles a silky tomato soup. Stir in the lemon juice and season with salt and pepper to taste. Cover and refrigerate up for up to 1 week or use immediately.
When you are ready to make the shakshuka, gently reheat the sauce and pour it into a 9x13-inch glass baking dish or six soufflé ramekins or small cazuelas (4 to 5 inches in diameter and at least 1-inch high).
To make in a 9x13-inch dish, first crack each egg into a small bowl or ramekin to ensure that the yolks stay intact. Using the back of a spoon, make a divot for each egg and slide it into the sauce, one at a time, so that it doesn’t float on top; leave a little space between each egg.
To make in individual baking dishes, set the ramekins onto a baking sheet. Ladle about 1/2 cup sauce into each dish and, using the back of a spoon, make a divot for the egg. To ensure that the yolks stay intact, first crack each egg into a small bowl or ramekin, then slide it into the sauce.
Lightly season the eggs with salt and transfer to the oven. Bake until the egg whites are just barely set and the yolks are very loose, about 20 minutes.
Remove the shakshuka from the oven. Scoop one egg on top of each pita bread and carefully spoon a generous amount of tomato sauce from the pan over the top of the egg. Place 1 teaspoon of zhoug on top of each serving and pass around additional zhoug at the table.

Clean, stem, and slice 1 to 1 1/2 pounds mushrooms. I like to combine a couple of medium-size portobello caps, thinly sliced, with some baby bellas (also known as cremini).

Add the mushrooms and cover. Cook until they’ve wilted down to your liking, about 5 to 8 minutes. If there’s plenty of liquid in the pan from the mushrooms, rather than drain it, thicken it with a couple of teaspoons of cornstarch dissolved in water or vegetable broth. To serve, ladle some of the mushroom mixture on top of individual servings of the pasta. Top with plenty of minced parsley and, for added plant power, some steamed fresh or frozen green peas.

(You can also put the steak directly in the mixing bowl, but you'll want to turn it at least once while the meat is marinating.) Refrigerate for at least 2 hours but no longer than overnight. When you're ready to start cooking, remove the steak from the marinade, pat dry, and let the meat come to room temperature.
2. Preheat an outdoor grill over a medium-high flame and brush the grates of the grill with oil so the meat doesn't stick. (You can also broil the meat in the oven.)
3. Sprinkle the meat with salt and pepper and grill (or broil) for about 7 minutes per side. I like mine medium-rare. If you don't, grill (or broil) about 2 minutes more.

Put the water, epazote, and salt into a small pan and bring to a boil. Lower the heat and simmer for about 5 minutes.
Spread the pumpkin seeds in a thin layer over the bottom of a large skillet and heat through gently over low heat, turning them over from time to time. The seeds will swell, but take care not to let them become even slightly golden or the sauce will lose its fresh green color. You might want to keep a lid handy because often some of the seeds will start jumping out of the pan. Spread the seeds onto a metal tray to cool completely before grinding to avoid the blades seizing up with the volatile oil.
Using an electric coffee/spice grinder, grind a portion of the seeds at a time to a slightly textured consistency, 5 to 6 seconds. If the seeds are ground too fine, then it will be more difficult to extract the oil.
Have a small glass bowl ready for the oil.
Put the ground seeds onto a plate that has a slight ridge around the rim. Measure out 1/4 cup (63ml) of the epazote broth and little by little sprinkle it — don't, for goodness' sake, pour the whole lot — over the seeds and work it with your hands, first having put the telephone on automatic answering. Gradually add the liquid until you have a crumbly but cohesive paste.
Tilt the plate a little to one side and put a folded cloth underneath to hold it in that position. Start squeezing the paste and you will see that drops of oil will begin to extrude. Add a little more warm liquid if necessary — you probably won't need the whole amount — and keep squeezing until you have collected almost 4 tablespoons of dark green oil. (This is pure vitamin E, and great for the hands.) Crumble the paste into a blender jar, add the remaining strained epazote broth, if desired, and blend until smooth.
Transfer the sauce to a skillet and warm through over the lowest possible heat, stirring almost constantly because the starch content of the seeds begins to swell and the particles tend to coagulate in the bottom of the pan.
Dip one of the warm tortillas into the sauce: it should be lightly covered. If the sauce is too thick, dilute it with a little extra warm water. Work as quickly as you can, dipping each tortilla into the sauce, holding it with tongs but supporting it with a spatula so you don't get left with a bit of broken tortilla in your tongs. Sprinkle some of the chopped egg across one-third of the tortilla, roll it up, and place it on the warmed dish.
When all the papadzules are assembled, pour the remaining sauce over them. (If the sauce has thickened and become grainy looking, put it back into the blender with a little extra warm water and blend until smooth.) Now pour on the tomato sauce and sprinkle the chopped egg whites and yolks. Decorate with the optional epazote. As a final touch, spoon in little pools of the oil. Serve immediately or the oil will sink back into the sauce and all that work will have been for naught! Of course, it is more colorful and attractive to serve the papadzules together on one serving dish.",papadzules-108163,"['2 1/2 cups (657ml) water', '2 large leafy stems of epazote', '1 scant teaspoon sea salt', '8 ounces (225g) hulled raw pumpkin seeds, about 1 2/3 cups (313ml)', '12 freshly made, warm corn tortillas, 5 to 5 1/2 inches (13-14cm) in diameter', '5 large hard-cooked eggs, shelled, roughly chopped, and salted', '1 cup (250ml) salsa', '2 large hard-cooked eggs, white and yolks separated and finely chopped', '12 epazote leaves (optional)']",corn

Meanwhile, bring an inch or two of water to a boil in a small pot. Whisk together the egg yolks, crème fraîche, Parmesan, and garlic in a large heatproof bowl that will fit snugly in the pot without making contact with the boiling water.
Set the bowl in the small pot and whisk the egg mixture constantly, occasionally scraping the sides and removing the bowl from the pot every couple of minutes as you whisk to keep the cooking nice and slow (don't let it bubble). The mixture will look thick and clumpy for a few seconds, then become liquidy, and then, once the cheese has melted, silky smooth.

Carefully lower egg in strainer into hot water until egg is completely submerged. Gently shake strainer and carefully shape egg with a slotted spoon until edges of egg white start to turn opaque, 30–60 seconds. Carefully release egg from strainer into water with slotted spoon. Cook egg, turning and shaping occasionally with slotted spoon, until egg white is opaque and firm and yolk is plump and jiggles slightly to the touch, 3–3 1/2 minutes more. Transfer egg using a slotted spoon to the ice bath. As the first egg cooks, repeat steps to poach remaining 3 eggs, but keep an eye on which egg went in first. Use a timer to avoid overcooking.
Bring the pot of water to a boil and cook fettuccine, stirring occasionally, until al dente. Using tongs or a spider, transfer pasta to a colander to drain. Reserve pasta cooking liquid in pot and set aside 1 cup liquid for the pasta sauce.

If you wish to soften the peel, soak the lemons in lukewarm water for 3 days, changing the water daily.
2. Quarter the lemons from the top to within 1/2 inch of the bottom, sprinkle salt on the exposed flesh, then reshape the fruit.
3. Place 1 tablespoon salt on the bottom of the mason jar. Pack in the lemons and push them down, adding more salt, and the optional spices between layers. Press the lemons down to release their juices and to make room for the remaining lemons. (If the juice released from the squashed fruit does not cover them, add freshly squeezed lemon juice — not chemically produced lemon juice and not water.*) Leave some air space before sealing the jar.
4. Let the lemons ripen in a warm place, shaking the jar each day to distribute the salt and juice. Let ripen for 30 days. To use, rinse the lemons, as needed, under running water, removing and discarding the pulp, if desired — and there is no need to refrigerate after opening. Preserved lemons will keep up to a year, and the pickling juice can be used two or three times over the course of a year.
According to the late Michael Field, the best way to extract the maximum amount of juice from a lemon is to boil it in water for 2 or 3 minutes and allow it to cool before squeezing.
•Located on Morocco's Atlantic coast, south of Casablanca and north of Essaouira, the city of Safi is known for its seafood specialties. •To most closely approximate the flavor of Moroccan lemons, Wolfert recommends Meyer lemons for this recipe. This lemon/mandarin orange hybrid, in season in January and February, has yellow-orange flesh, a smooth rind, and a sweeter flavor than other lemons. •To sterilize a mason jar for the lemons, place it upside down in a steamer and steam for 10 minutes. Using tongs (wrap the ends in rubber bands for a better grip), remove the hot jar and dry it upside down on a paper towel-lined baking sheet in a warm oven. To sterilize the jar's top, boil it in water for 5 minutes, then remove with tongs. For more information on home canning, click here. •When you're ready to use a lemon, remove it with clean utensils to avoid contaminating the inside of the jar with bacteria. This way, the remaining contents of the jar will not need to be refrigerated.",preserved-lemons-231570,"['5 lemons', '1/4 cup salt, more if desired', '1 cinnamon stick', '3 cloves', '5 to 6 coriander seeds', '3 to 4 black peppercorns', '1 bay leaf', 'Freshly squeezed lemon juice, if necessary', 'Shallow bowl', 'Sterile 1-pint mason jar', 'Sharp knife']","corn, lemon"

Combine the quinoa and 1/2 cup water in a very small saucepan with a lid. Bring to a boil, cover the pot, and lower the heat to the slowest possible simmer, with a heat diffuser, if you have one, underneath. You'll have cooked quinoa in about 20 minutes. Uncover, fluff with a fork, and set aside.
2. Meanwhile, cut the sweet potato into rounds about 1 1/2 inches thick and steam over or cook in boiling water until fork-soft, about 15 minutes. Cool until comfortable to handle. Strip off and discard the peels and transfer to a food processor.
3. Add the chickpeas, ginger, garlic, scallions, 3/4 teaspoon salt, cumin, and 2 tablespoons of the lemon juice to the sweet potato and process until reasonably blended. It doesn't need to be completely smooth.
4. Transfer the mixture to a bowl, then sprinkle in the cooked quinoa and the quinoa flour. Stir until all the quinoa disappears into the mixture. Gently fold in the green peas and peanuts, if using. Taste to see if it needs more salt or lemon juice and add a few big pinches of crushed red pepper flakes to taste.
5. Place a medium skillet over medium heat for about a minute, then add a scant 1/2 tablespoon oil and swirl to coat the pan. Heat for a little longer, until the oil is hot enough to instantly sizzle a dot of the sweet potato mixture. Turn the heat to low.
6. Use a nonstick-sprayed 1/3-cup measure to scoop-shape the batter as uniformly as possible. Carefully transfer as many burgers as will fit in a single layer to the hot, oiled pan, knocking the cup handle assertively against the side of the pan or using the back of a spoon to release the batter. Smooth the top surface with a dinner knife, so the burgers will crisp evenly, and push in the sides to help them keep their shape as they cook.
7. Cook over low heat for 8 to 10 minutes, or until golden brown on the bottom. (Longer cooking is OK—just not hotter. The sugar content of sweet potatoes causes them to burn easily at higher temperatures.) Use a small spatula with a thin blade to carefully loosen each burger and flip it over, adding more oil as needed and pushing the burgers back into shape if they slump or break.
8. Cook on the second side for 8 to 10 minutes, or until the bottoms are nicely browned. Continue to cook in batches until all the batter has been used. Serve hot or warm.

The squash, depending on its size, will cook in 45 minutes to 1 1/2 hours. It is done when the skin is charred and the squash deflates a little with light pressure. Let it cool for 20 minutes.
Cut the squash in half, then scoop out and discard the seeds, being careful not to remove too much of the flesh when you do this. Remove the flesh from the skin—scrape right down to the skin, because that is where all the sweet, awesome smoke flavor is! If some charred flakes get mixed in, that's fine.
Place the flesh in a food processor. Add the tahini, lemon juice, and garlic if using. Purée the mixture until it is relatively smooth but there are still a few chunks. Season with a few pinches of salt and then, with the machine running, add the olive oil in a slow, steady stream through the feed tube. The mixture will begin to change color as the olive oil is incorporated. After you have added about 1 cup of the oil, stop the machine, scrape down the side, and taste the hummus. If you think it needs a little more salt, then go ahead and add it. The mixture should be thick at this point, close to a mayonnaise in texture. Turn the machine back on and add another cup of oil, then taste again. The hummus should have a balanced, sweet-sour-smoky-rich flavor. If it seems not quite right, or too thick, continue to add as much of the remaining oil as you need to get the right consistency.
This is best if it is left to chill for a couple of hours before serving, but it can be served right away. Before presenting it to your guests, check the flavor balance one more time and adjust if necessary with more salt and/or lemon juice.

Most utensils and storage containers can be sanitized in the dishwasher (some machines have a sanitize setting). Alternatively, sterilize everything in boiling water.
Prepare an ice bath, filling a large bowl or sink with ice.
Attach a candy thermometer to a heavy, large pot and add the milk. Place the pot over moderate heat and heat the milk until it reaches at least 180°F or boils, stirring occasionally to prevent a skin from forming and making sure the milk doesn't scald or boil over. Alternatively, place the milk in a large microwave-safe bowl or a large glass measuring cup with a spout (for easy pouring) and microwave it in 2- to 3-minute intervals, until it reaches 180° or boils.
Remove the milk from the heat and allow it to cool to 110°F to 115°F. To speed the cooling process, place the pot in the prepared ice bath and stir the milk occasionally. (If the milk temperature drops too low, return it to the heat.)
If using yogurt as a starter culture: In a small bowl, combine about 1 cup warm milk with the yogurt and stir to combine. Add the yogurt-milk mixture to the remaining warm milk and stir until completely incorporated. Do not stir vigorously.
If using a powdered yogurt culture: Follow the manufacturer's instructions and add the specified amount of powdered culture to the warm milk; whisk until completely incorporated. Do not stir vigorously.
Pour or ladle the mixture into the yogurt maker containers or another incubator (if using a thermos, first warm the inside with hot tap water) and incubate between 110°F and 115°F for 5 to 10 hours, depending on the desired flavor and consistency—longer incubation periods produces thicker, more tart yogurt. Do not disturb the yogurt during incubation.
Cover the yogurt and refrigerate until cold, 2 to 3 hours. (If you used a thermos to incubate, transfer the finished yogurt to a non-insulated container for chilling so the temperature will drop.) Stir any flavorings into the yogurt just before serving. (For thicker, Greek-style yogurt, after incubation, spoon the yogurt into a cheesecloth-lined colander set over a bowl and let it drain, covered in the refrigerator, for at least 1 hour or overnight. Discard the whey that drains out of the yogurt or reserve it for another use.)
Yogurt can be stored in the refrigerator, in covered glass, ceramic, or plastic containers, for up to 2 weeks, but the flavor will be the best during the first week. As yogurt ages, it becomes more tart. If more whey separates out of the yogurt, just stir it back in before serving.",homemade-yogurt-395111,"['4 cups (1 quart) milk', '3 tablespoons plain yogurt (purchased or homemade)* or powdered yogurt starter (amount specified on package)**', 'Flavorings such as jam, honey, dulce de leche, molasses, fresh or dried fruit, garlic, herbs, etc (optional)', '""*If using store-bought yogurt, choose a yogurt that tastes good to you.

With a pastry brush, dust the slices thoroughly with some of the cornstarch. Pull gently to separate the crescent shapes, dusting again with a bit more cornstarch. Add the carrot and sweet potato peels to the bowl and dust with the remaining cornstarch. Toss to distribute the vegetables evenly.
To make the summer pancakes, with a pastry brush, dust the bitter melon slices thoroughly with some of the cornstarch, then place them in a bowl. Dust the zucchini slices and kabocha peels in a similar manner and add them to the bowl; toss to distribute evenly. Dust the shredded shiso leaves and chives with cornstarch and add them to the bowl; toss again to distribute evenly.
Make the batter just before frying: Place the ice cubes in a small bowl with half of the water. Sift the cake flour over the water and stir to mix slightly; there should still be lumps. If needed, add water, a few drops at a time, until the batter is the consistency of a thin pancake batter.
Pour the vegetable oil to a depth of 1 1/2 inches into a small wok or small, deep skillet. Add the sesame oil and heat slowly. Check the temperature with an unvarnished long wooden chopstick (or a bamboo skewer). Small bubbles will form around the tip when the oil is about 350°F. Wait for about 45 seconds longer to allow the temperature to rise a bit more—to about 370°F—and then test the oil temperature with a few drops of batter. If they sink slightly, then rise to the surface and puff quickly but do not color, the oil is ready. You may need to fry the pancakes in batches to avoid crowding them in the pan. Preheat the oven to 200°F for keeping the cooked pancakes warm.
Spoon a bit of the batter over the cornstarch-dusted vegetables and toss lightly to coat the vegetables with the batter. Dip a large spoon or ladle into the hot oil. Place one-eighth of the vegetable mixture in the bowl of the oil-dipped spoon. Carefully tilt the spoon to slide the pancake into the hot oil, aiming to make a disk about 2 inches in diameter. The batter and cornstarch act as ""glue"" to keep the vegetable slivers together. Repeat to make more pancakes, being careful not to crowd the pan.
Most important, refrain from touching the pancakes for a full 30 seconds after you place them in the oil. It will seem like an eternity, but gaman will yield the best results. If wayward bits are strewn at the edges of your pan, carefully pick them up and place them on top of the still-moist pancake batter in the center. (Skill with long chopsticks will be well rewarded, though a long-handled fine-mesh skimmer can scoop beneath as well.) If the center of the pancake is very dry, dip the wayward bits in some fresh batter before ""gluing"" them in place. When the batter in the center of the disk seems barely moist, carefully invert the pancake.
After flipping, allow the pancakes to fry undisturbed for about 1 minute, or until crisp. Using cooking chopsticks or a skimmer, remove the pancakes from the oil and place them on a rack set over a baking sheet to drain. If frying in batches, place the baking sheet in the oven to keep the fried pancakes warm. Use the skimmer to clear the oil of batter bits between batches.
When all of the pancakes are fried, transfer them to paper towels to absorb any additional surface oil.",heaven-and-earth-tempura-cakes-363169,"['1/2 red onion, cut into thin slices through the stem end to make crescent shapes (about 1/3 cup)', '1 tablespoon cornstarch', 'Scant 1/3 cup julienne-cut carrot peels (1-inch strips; about 3 ounces)', 'Scant 1/3 cup julienne-cut Japanese-style sweet potato or other sweet potato peels (1-inch strips; about 2 1/2 ounces)', '3-ounce chunk bitter melon, cut in half lengthwise, seeds removed, very thinly sliced, salted with 1/4 teaspoon salt, and drained, about 1/4 cup', '1 tablespoon cornstarch', '2 small zucchini, about 4 ounces total weight, tops trimmed, cut in half lengthwise, and then cut on the diagonal into thin slices, about 2/3 cup', 'Scant 1/3 cup julienne-cut kabocha squash peels (3/4-inch strips; about 3 ounces)', '2 tablespoons finely shredded summer herbs such as fresh shiso leaves', '4 or 5 fresh chives, cut into 1/2-inch lengths', 'Several ice cubes', '1/3 cup cold water', '1/4 cup self-rising cake flour', 'Vegetable oil for deep-frying', '1 to 2 teaspoons aromatic sesame oil (optional)', '1/4 teaspoon kosher salt', 'Generous pinch of kona-zanshõ', 'Generous pinch of tõgarashi', 'Generous pinch of freshly ground black pepper', 'Lemon or lime wedges']","carrot, corn, lemon, onion, potato"

Add the xanthan gum, guar gum, and salt and stir. Sift the entire mixture into the bowl of a stand mixer.
Put the eggs and egg yolks into the bowl of dry ingredients. Run the stand mixer on medium speed with a paddle attachment until the dough feels fully formed, about 3 minutes. The final dough should feel firm yet still pliable, a little like playdough.
If you are using a pasta machine, cut the ball of dough into quarters and roll out each piece of dough to about a 1/2-inch thickness. We like to roll out each piece between 2 pieces of parchment paper. Lightly flour both sides of the dough with a bit more potato starch. Run the dough through the machine, increasing the setting each time, until the dough is paper-thin and long. If the pasta sheet starts to break, it is thin enough.
If you are making the dough by hand, we suggest you cut the ball of dough into 8 pieces, and then cut each of those pieces in half, so they are about the size of golf balls. Roll out each piece of dough as thin as you possibly can.
For fettuccine, use the fettuccine setting on the pasta machine. If you are cutting the dough by hand, you want ribbons of pasta, about 1/4-inch wide. For spaghetti, use the spaghetti setting on the pasta machine. If you are cutting the dough by hand, you want thin strings of pasta.
For ravioli, cut the rolled-out pasta into 2-inch-square pieces. Dollop the filling in the middle of a square of pasta. Brush the edges of the pasta with an egg wash. Place another pasta square on top and press down, crimping the edges. (Having a ravioli cutter on hand helps with this process.)
For lasagna, leave the pasta in long sheets.
To cook the pasta, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Put the pasta shape of your choice into the boiling water. When the pasta rises to the surface, take a little piece and taste it. You should be able to bite into it without it falling apart. (With gluten-free pasta, it's a fine line. One moment it's al dente, and the next it's one big ball of mush, so watch the pot.) Cooking times will vary for the different shapes. Fettuccine generally takes 4 to 5 minutes, spaghetti 3 to 4 minutes. Ravioli takes a little longer, about 5 to 6 minutes. The cooking times will differ in each kitchen, depending on how thin you were able to roll out the dough. Let your taste be the judge.",fresh-gluten-free-pasta-362249,"['2/3 cup (70g/2.5oz) corn flour', '1/2 cup (70g/2.5oz) quinoa flour', '1/2 cup (60g/2.125oz) potato starch', '2 teaspoons xanthan gum', '1 teaspoon guar gum', '1 teaspoon fine sea salt', '2 large eggs', '4 egg yolks from large eggs']","corn, potato"

Separate the Oreos, scraping off the cream center with a table knife, so that you have 48 hat pieces; set aside.
Melt the dark green candy coating in a microwave-safe plastic bowl, following the instructions on the package. The coating should be about 3 inches deep for easier dipping. (I usually work with about 16 ounces of coating at a time.)
When you are ready to dip, remove a few shaped cake balls at a time from the refrigerator, keeping the rest chilled.
One at a time, dip about 1/2 inch of the tip of a lollipop stick in the melted candy coating, and insert the stick straight into the bottom of an oval-shaped cake ball, pushing it no more than halfway through. Dip the cake pop into the melted coating, and tap off any excess coating. Hold the pop over the bowl in one hand, and tap your wrist gently with your other hand. If you use the hand holding the cake pop to shake off excess coating, the force of the movement will be too strong and could cause the cake ball to loosen or fly off the lollipop stick. Tapping the wrist holding the cake pop absorbs some of the impact. The excess coating will fall off, but you will need to rotate the lollipop stick so the coating doesn't build up on one side, making it too heavy on that side. If too much coating starts to build up at the base of the stick, simply use your finger to wipe it off, spinning the lollipop stick at the same time. This can happen if the coating is too thin or too hot. It's not as hard as it sounds; it just takes a little practice.
Before the coating sets, attach a Tic Tac in position for the nose and an Oreo cookie half on top for the hat. Attach two 1 1/2-inch licorice wheel sections on either side of the witch's head for hair. Hold them in place until the candy coating sets like glue, and place in the Styrofoam block to dry. You can add more coating on the sides to attach the pieces if the coating sets too fast.
When the pops are dry, use a toothpick to dot a small amount of melted candy coating in position for the eyes, and attach 2 orange jimmies on each cake pop.
To finish the hats, tear off the paper sticking out of each Hershey's Kiss, and use a toothpick to apply a small amount of coating on the center of the Oreo hat bottom. Attach the wrapped chocolate candy in place and let dry.
Draw mouths with a black edible-ink pen, and let dry completely in the Styrofoam block.
The hats are delicate and may not do well if you will be transporting or wrapping them. They would be better served at a home Halloween gathering.",spooky-witches-361533,"['48 uncoated Basic Cake Balls , formed into oval shapes and chilled', '24 Oreos', 'Table knife', '48 ounces (3 pounds) dark green candy coating', 'Deep, microwave-safe plastic bowl', '48 paper lollipop sticks', '48 green Tic Tac mints', 'Licorice wheels, cut into 192 pieces, each 1 1/2 inches long', 'Styrofoam block', 'Toothpicks', '96 orange jimmies', '""48 Hersheys Kisses Brand Special Dark Chocolates""', 'Black edible-ink pen']",orange

Prepare an indirect fire in your grill with a hot fire on one side and no fire on the other. For a charcoal grill, soak 1 cup wood chips or corncobs in water for at least 30 minutes and place directly on the hot coals when ready to plank. For a gas grill, place 1/2 cup dry wood chips or corncobs in a smoker box (or wrap chips in aluminum foil and poke holes in the foil) and place over direct heat in the back of the grill.
2. In the cavity of each fish, place 2 sprigs each of tarragon, dill, and parsley, and 2 stems of chives. Season with salt and pepper. Place 2 fish on each plank.
3. Brush the cut sides of the lemons and onions with olive oil.
4. When you see the first wisp of smoke, place the planks on the indirect side of the grill. Set the onion and lemon halves, cut side down, directly on the grate over the fire and close the lid.
5. Check the lemons after 2 or 3 minutes. If they have nice grill marks, remove them from the grill. The onions will take an additional 10 to 15 minutes and may be turned after the first 10 to 12 minutes. When they are nicely charred, remove them from the grill, too. Close the lid and continue to cook the fish until it is opaque and begins to flake when tested with a fork, 45 to 60 minutes total.
6. Fillet the char and serve on a platter with the lemon and onion halves.
Oven Smoke-Planking: Preheat the oven to 400°F. Place 1/2 cup dry wood chips or corncobs in a small metal pan on the bottom rack of the oven and let smolder for about 15 minutes before planking. Place the herb-stuffed planked fish in the middle of the oven. Oven smoke-plank for 45 to 60 minutes, or until the fish is opaque and begins to flake when tested with a fork.

Raise the heat to high, then use your hands to crush each tomato into the pan, allowing the juice to fall into the skillet. Season lightly with salt and pepper. Fry the tomatoes, continuing to break them up with the fork. Cook until they concentrate and no longer look watery, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the basil.
Lower the heat to medium and stir in the egg whites. Cook until the whites become opaque and firm, thickening the tomato sauce, about 1 minute.
Turn off the heat. Using the back of a spoon, make 4 indentations in the sauce, allowing a few inches around each. Slip an egg yolk into each indentation. Draw the sauce in from the edges of the pan around each of the yolks. Cover the skillet and leave it on the stove, heat off, until the yolks are just warmed through and beginning to set, about 3 minutes for runny yolks.

Put enough eggplant slices on the grill to cover it without crowding. Cook the eggplant until well marked, 3 to 6 minutes, then turn the slices over. Cook until tender, about 3 minutes more. Remove the eggplant from the grill.
Pour the vinegar into a shallow bowl. While still hot, dip each eggplant slice into the vinegar and set it aside on a plate. Continue grilling and dipping the eggplant until all the slices are cooked and seasoned.
Spoon 2 tablespoons of the parsley mixture onto a platter and spread it evenly with the back of a spoon. Arrange half of the grilled eggplant on the parsley in a single layer. Smear each slice of eggplant with more parsley. Place a second layer of eggplant on top and spread the remaining parsley on it. Cover the dish with plastic wrap and set aside to marinate at room temperature for about 2 hours (or refrigerate for longer). Serve at room temperature.
You could make the parsley mixture in a food processor, but I don't. I find hand chopping gives me the somewhat drier texture I prefer.

3. Cut a quart-size resealable plastic bag open down both sides, to form a rectangle. Use the bag to line a tortilla press as you shape the tortillas, so they do not stick: Lay one side of the plastic over the bottom of the press, place a ball of dough in the center, and fold the other side of the plastic over the dough. Shut the top of the tortilla press firmly down on the dough to shape the tortilla. (See Note.)
4. Heat a griddle until hot. Place a tortilla on the griddle and cook for 1 1/2 minutes.

Bring to a boil, set the cover ajar (rest it on a wooden spoon set on the rim of the pan), and cook at a steady bubbling boil for 20 minutes or more, until the cod is easy to flake but still has body and shape. Don't let it start to break apart. Lift it out of the cooking water, and let it drain and cool in a colander. Reserve a cup of the cooking water.
Meanwhile, rinse the potato but leave it whole and unpeeled. Put it in a small pot covered with cold water. Bring to the boil, and cook steadily until you can easily pierce the potato with a knife blade.
Let it cool, and peel it.
Set up the electric mixer and flake all the fish into the bowl. Beat with the paddle at low speed to break the fish up more; drop in the minced garlic, and beat at medium speed while you pour in half the olive oil very gradually in a thin stream, then add the potato and incorporate it; continue beating at low speed as you gradually add the rest of the oil.
Now raise the speed to high and whip the fish to lighten it.
Reduce the speed to medium and incorporate the half-and- half gradually, then whip at high speed again. At this point the whipped cod should be smooth and fluffy, almost like mashed potatoes but with texture. If it is very dense, you can thin it with the cooking water (but be careful: too much water will make it too salty).
Finally, season with pepper and beat it in to blend. If you use a food processor instead of a mixer, follow the same order of additions, and process as needed to form a light, smooth spread. Put the spread in containers and store sealed, in the refrigerator, for up to a week.

Place in a bowl, add water to cover generously, and let soak for at least 2 hours or up to overnight.
Drain the beans, place in a pot, and add water to cover by about 2 inches. Bring the beans to a boil over high heat, adjust the heat to a slow simmer, and cook, uncovered, for 1 to 1 1/2 hours, or until tender. Season with 1 teaspoon salt and remove from the heat. Let cool completely, transfer the beans and their liquid to a storage container, and refrigerate overnight. Drain the beans, reserving their liquid. You should have 1 to 2 cups liquid, and you will need 2 cups for this recipe. If you have less than 2 cups, add water to the cooking liquid to bring it to 2 cups.
In a large, heavy-bottomed pot, heat 1/3 cup of the olive oil over medium heat. Stir in 3 of the garlic cloves, the strips of lemon zest, 1 bay leaf, and 2 teaspoons kosher salt and cook, stirring occasionally, for 3 minutes, or until the garlic begins to soften. Add the octopus, stir to coat it with the oil, and then weight it down with a plate or lid to ensure it does not begin to float once it starts releasing its water. Cover the pot and adjust the heat to a gentle simmer. The octopus should start slowly releasing its water, creating its own braising liquid.
Cook for about 30 minutes and check to see how much braising liquid is in the pot. If it is about 1 cup or less (unlikely if you are using an uncooked whole octopus), add 1 cup of water. Check the tenderness and continue to cook for 30 to 50 minutes longer, or until almost completely tender. The octopus will dramatically decrease in volume. Remove the pot from the heat and allow the octopus to cool in the braising liquid for 1 hour.
Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to boil. Add the escarole and cook for about 3 minutes, or until tender. Drain well and when cool enough to handle, chop the leaves coarsely and set aside.
Place a colander over a large bowl. Once the octopus has cooled for 1 hour, transfer it to the colander. Strain the braising liquid through a fine-mesh strainer into a measuring pitcher. Add any extra liquid that has drained from the octopus into the bowl to the braising liquid. You will need 1 cup for the zuppa. Give the pot used to cook the octopus a quick wash and return it to the stove.
Transfer the octopus to a large cutting board. Starting at the thickest point of the tentacle, slice into 1/4-inch-thick-pieces, increasing the thickness of the pieces as the tentacle becomes narrower. Halve the head, then cut it into 1/4-inch strips. Set aside.
To prepare the zuppa, heat the remaining 1/3 cup olive oil in the cleaned pot over medium heat. Add the remaining 3 garlic cloves, the celery, the chiles, and the remaining bay leaf and stir well. Stir in the beans and the reserved cooking liquid. Stir in the octopus and the reserved braising liquid. Heat until hot and then taste for seasoning, adding more salt if needed. Stir in the escarole and simmer for a few minutes more.

Stir in just enough of the bread flour to make a batter about the consistency of buttermilk. Cover and let proof in a warm place until the surface is puffy, about 1 hour.
Add the remaining bread flour, the semolina flour, and the salt. Knead in a stand mixer fitted with dough hook on medium speed, or by hand, until the dough is smooth, springy, and elastic, 4 minutes with the mixer or 10 minutes by hand. Rub the dough lightly with oil, place in a clean bowl, and cover with a cloth. Let the dough rise at warm room temperature until doubled in volume, about 1 1/2 hours.
Punch down the dough, sinking your fist into it to deflate it, and divide into 4 equal pieces for individual pizzas or leave it whole for a large pizza. Form the dough into smooth ball(s), cover, and let rise again until doubled in volume, 45-60 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 450°F. Lightly oil a 16-inch pizza pan or large baking sheet with vegetable oil or scatter with cornmeal.
On a lightly floured surface, roll and stretch out the ball(s) of dough to an even 1/4-inch thickness. If the dough has not relaxed properly, it may spring back as you stretch it; simultaneously spinning and stretching the dough will help. (This may be accomplished flat on a work surface or by spinning and tossing it into the air, then catching the disk on the back of your hands. Avoid tearing the dough or creating very thin patches.) Transfer the dough round to the prepared pan.
For the topping, mix together the olive oil, basil, oregano, garlic, and pepper to taste. Spread this mixture evenly over the pizza dough. Spread evenly with the tomato purée and top with the sliced tomatoes and mozzarella. Scatter the Parmesan over the top.
Bake until the dough is golden brown and the toppings are very hot, 20-30 minutes for 1 large pizza or 10-12 minutes for individual rounds.
